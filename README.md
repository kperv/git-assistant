Let Git Assistant answer them in short and useful way. 


## Technologies

* LLM: LLama3
* Knowledge base: Elasticsearch (with Hybrid Search Text + Vector)
* Interface: Streamlit

## Evaluation

### Offline evaluation
A dataset with 50 git related questions and answers was generated for evaluation.
Model `gpt-4o-mini` was used for judging and generating ground truth data.

Evaluation results:
* mean cosine similarity between true answers and assistant answers is 44%
* LLM-as-a-judge method results:

|relevancy|count|
|--------|----|
|RELEVANT|31|
|PARTLY_RELEVANT|11|
|NON_RELEVANT|11|

## Steps to reproduce

### application

set up llama3 in ollama

then run bash script
``` bash
./run.sh
```
The application will be on 80 port.

### evaluation

``` bash
python eval.py
python eval_with_llm.py
```

## Deployment to the Cloud

The project is deployed on a remote machine with 2 GPUs.
Port 80 is used to map Streamlit app to domain git-assistant.pro
